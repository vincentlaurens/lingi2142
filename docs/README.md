This directory contains the starting resources for the student:

  * [The project introduction slides](project_introduction.pdf) Provide an
      high-level overview of the projects for the students:
      the topology of the project, how VMs are connected on a remote server,
      and the expected properties of the interfaces connected to the simulated 
      POPs.
  * [A presentation of the UCLouvain network](ucl_network_qhunin.pdf), 
      given by one of the network engineer of the campus. 
      This showcases various elements of a
      network that students use on a daily basis, and that will act as example
      of what they can replicate in their emulated networks.
