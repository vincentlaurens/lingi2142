This directory contains the starting resources for the student:

  * [The project introduction slides](project_introduction.pdf) Provide an
      high-level overview of the projects for the students
  * [The project topology description](project_topology_description.pdf)
      Introduces the topology of the project, as well as explains how VMs are
      connected on a remote server, and the expected properties of the
      interfaces connected to the simulated POPs.
  * [A presentation of the UCLouvain
      network](presentation_of_the_ucl_network.pdf), given by one of the
      network engineer of the campus. This showcases various elements of a
      network that students use on a daily basis, and that will act as example
      of what they can replicate in their emulated networks.
  * A short [checklist](checklist.tex) of features that should be found in all
      student implementations as well as submission instructions.
