==== CHANGELOG ====

* Instead of having all ours servers scattered accross 4-5 datacenters, we decided to have two main datacenters in mirror, each of them containing instances of all the services. We also renamed our servers to indicate their service (ST1 -> DHCP1, CA1 -> WEB11, etc).
* Fixing DHCP which was bugging on some LANs
* Added PTR records (forgot to implement them for the first submission)
* Added monitoring (hadn't time to do it before the first submission)
* Made a new script to generate properly SSH keys (based on suggestions from the peer reviews)
* Added a descriptive README
* Firewall
- Set the last routers to DROP as default policies
- Add a policy to filter spoofed ip addresses from the outside
- Add forgotten rules for OSPF
- Add rules for "phones"
- Add a test script (firewall/run_tests.sh)
- Fix wrong number port of DNS for students
